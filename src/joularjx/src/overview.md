JoularJX is part of the <a href="https://www.noureddine.org/research/joular/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joular/.github/main/profile/joular.png" alt="Joular Project" width="64" /></a> project.

JoularJX is a Java-based agent for power monitoring at the source code level with support for modern Java versions and multi-OS to monitor power consumption of hardware and software.

JoularJX is a Java agent where you can simply hook it to the Java Virtual Machine when starting your Java program. To get power readings, JoularJX uses a custom PowerMonitor program (based on Hubblo's Windows RAPL driver) on Windows, Intel RAPL (through powercap) on GNU/Linux, Powermetrics on macOS, and our accurate power models on Raspberry Pi and similar devices.

JoularJX is the successor of [Jalen](https://www.noureddine.org/research/jalen), and the core approach of statistical sampling is based and inspired by the work we did in monitoring energy hotspots in software ([ASE 2012 conference paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00715331/document), and [ASE Journal paper in 2015](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01069142/document)).

## Features

- Monitor power consumption of each method at runtime
- Monitor the evolution of power consumption of each method
- Monitor power consumption of methods' call tree and execution branches
- Monitor energy of Java applications running in virtual machines
- Uses a Java agent, no source code instrumentation needed
- Uses Intel RAPL (powercap interface) for getting accurate power reading on GNU/Linux, our research-based regression models on Raspberry Pi devices, and a custom program monitor (based on Intel Power Gadget) for accurate power readings on Windows
- Provides real-time power consumption of every method in the monitored program
- Provides total energy for every method on program exit
