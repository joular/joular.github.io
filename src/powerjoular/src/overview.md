PowerJoular is a command line software to monitor, in real time, the power consumption of software and hardware components.

PowerJoular is part of the <a href="https://www.noureddine.org/research/joular/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joular/.github/main/profile/joular.png" alt="Joular Project" width="64" /></a> project.

PowerJoular can monitor the power consumption, in real time, of the CPU and the GPU in general, and also for a specific application (through its name or PID).
It works on a Linux system and on multiple platforms (x86_64, ARM) and devices (computers, servers, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

The official website of PowerJoular is: [https://www.noureddine.org/research/joular/powerjoular](https://www.noureddine.org/research/joular/powerjoular).

## Features

- Monitor power consumption of CPU and GPU of PC/servers
- Monitor power consumption of individual applications or processes in GNU/Linux
- Expose power consumption to the terminal and CSV files
- Provides a systemd service (daemon) to continuously monitor power of devices
- Low overhead (written in Ada and compiled to native code)
